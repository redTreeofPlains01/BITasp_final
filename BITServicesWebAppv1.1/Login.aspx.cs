                QueryString is the easiest way to pass data between
                two pages: HTML->ASPX or ASPX -> ASPX because
                QueryString is an ASP.NET Object
                like Response, Request pagename.ext? sessionid = ojheroiwerj8343 & username = 98247kljsdflkjkf
                no limitations on how much you can pass as a querystring(QueryString
                in ASP.NET is a collection of(data, value) pair
                       the only issue is if you are thinking of passing a particular data
                       between multiple pages then you need to keep on passing this value again and again for all other pages

                Remember session is actually a Collection at the server level so keep on adding as many sessions as you need it
